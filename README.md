## Inspiration
I wanted to write conventional commit messages but I was too lazy to write them manually. So I created this tool to help me write conventional commits.

Use this tool to 
- Create and Commit conventional commits
- Other git chores

## Install

```bash
go install -v github.com/rajnandan1/okgit@latest
```

## Documentation

```bash
okgit --help
```

## Setup
Update you `.gitignore` file to ignore the `.okgit` directory.

```
echo ".okgit/" >> .gitignore
```
